## Introduction

The United States energy consumption is one of the biggest in the world with residential sectors representing approximately 40 percent^[https://www.nap.edu/catalog/13360/effective-tracking-of-building-energy-use-improving-the-commercial-buildings] of it. Here we explore data collected via *Residential Energy Consumption Survey*^[https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/about.php] conducted by the *US Energy Information Administration* in 2009. Using this data we perfom regression analysis and test a hypothesis that there a difference in average annual bill for different types of settlements and year of construction. We build a first model for predicting annual energy consumption, in US dollars, of a household from various household's features and consumption habit of its tenants. In addition to that we test factors that are commonly assumed to affect energy bill with our second model.

## Data Description

The *US Residential Energy Consumption Survey*  is a comprehensive data collection program that was conducted by the *US Energy Information Administration*^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration]. 

The data file can be obtained from the [www.eia.gov](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2015/index.php?view=microdata) website and is formatted as a CSV file. The file contains responses from 12083 randomly selected sample of the population of 113.6 million US households. Response is coded using 940 variables, which can be broken down into following categories:

* 359 imputation flags.
* 85 measurements of various energy consumption metrics.
* 58 various quantitative measurements, collected from a household or its tenants.
* 438 categorical features of a household.

## Exploratory Analysis

For our analisys and models we considered only 58 quantitative and 438 categorical features of a household and dropped 359 imputation flags as well as 85 measurements of energy consumption metrics. For our first model we've been primaraly interested in predicting total energy bill per household that has been recorded as a separate variable, in whole US dollars. 

To better understand relationship between total yearly cost and household's features we looked at correlation matrix of all quantitative plus our dependent variable. The plot is depicted in \autoref{fig1}

By scanning through correlation matrix we've identified several good candidates for strong predictor variables: total square footage, total number of rooms, number of rooms heated, number of ceiling fans used, number of televisions used, heating degree days in 2009 above 65F. From \autoref{fig2} you can see there is a clear linear relashionship between all of these variables and a response we are trying to predict.

In addition to that we've used our intuition to select following variables for further analysis:

## Regression Analysis

First goal of our analysis is to model total energy bill of a household using best subset of predictors. All our models are based on linear regression:

\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
y = X\beta + \epsilon
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $X$ is a $x \times k$ matrix with $k$ observation and $n$ independent variables, $y$ is a $n \times 1$ vector of observations, $\epsilon$ is a $n \times 1$ irreducible error vector and  $\beta$ be a $k \times 1$ vector of parameters that we want to estimate.

### Predictive Model

To select a best predictive model we assembeled an ordered list of qualitative and quantitative predictors using scatterplots and our intuition as a guideline. The final list can be found in \autoref{table1}. Next, we have assembled 22 models starting from a simple model with just one predictor and each subsequent model having increasing number of predictors from \autoref{table1}. We've measured BIC, AIC and CV metrics for each model. Resulting plots can be found in \autoref{fig3}. After looking at these plots we concluded that the best predictive model is the model build from predictors marked with a star in \autoref{table1}.

### Descriptive Model  

With our second model we decided to test predictors that are commonly assumed to have great influence on energy bill. From our experience we know following factors are thought to be important (see \autoref{table4}):

* We want to see if air cooling and heating contributes to the total dollar energy consuption. Therefore, the indicator for air conditioner *AIRCOND* and heating equipment *EQUIPNOHEAT* are included.
* Does temperature influence the use of central air and heating? Here we included variables *HDD65* (heating degree days) and *CDD65* (cooling degree days).
* Other factors that characterize a household and a building, since these influence the efficiency of a household as well as usage of the air cooling and heating systems. Therefore, the variables *HHAGE* (household age), *SQFT_100* (total square footage of the building as *TOTSQFT*/100), *ATHOME* (if the person is at home), *TOTROOMS* (number of rooms), *YEARMADE* (when the house was built),*TOTHSQFT* (total heating square footage), *TOTCSQFT* (total cooling square footage) are part of the model. 
* Any interactions between these variables.

The final estimates for the model can be found in \autoref{table5}. The model can be described using following equation:   

\begin{multline}
log(Dollar)= 11.20 + 0.0097 * sqft100 - 0.001492 * HHAGE - \\
 0.05925 * ATHOME + 0.003291 * TEMPGONE + 0.09193 * TOTROOMS - \\
 0.002504 * YEARMADE - 0.36051 * AIRCOND + 0.00011723 * CDD30YR + \\
 0.00004345 * HDD30YR + 0.00005129 * HDD30YR * AIRCOND
\end{multline}

We have determined that while the model fits data relatively well and all p-values are below threshold of 0.05 cutoff for significance, most of the predictors in this model have surprisingly low practical influence on annual energy bill. Final AIC, BIC and CV metrics for this model were 13854.78, 13943.57 and 0.42 respectively, where our best predictive model gave us 8122.132 (AIC), 10556.48 (BIC) and 0.33 (CV). On the other hand, since we have over 12,000 observations there is a chance that the test statistics could be very sensitive to minor differences, and so practical vs. statistical interpretation is used to determine if the variable is necessary or not. After comparing this model to our best predictive model we realized that, for example, number of windows, gross household income and number of televisions used are far more important predictors of the annual energy bill.

Here is how we interpret final estimates of descriptive model.

* For every 100 square foot increase of the building leads to a multiplicative change of 1.009758 with a 95% confidence range of 1.00896 to 1.01056 in Median value of total energy expenditure.        
* For every 1 year increase in the age of the household leads to a multiplicative change of 0.99850911 with a 95% confidence range of 0.998026 to 0.998993 in Median value of total energy expenditure.      
* When comparing people at home vs. people not at home, people not a home has a multiplicative change of 0.94246687 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.92728 to 0.95790 in Median value of total energy expenditure when compared to people at home.          
* For every 1 degree increase in temperature when not at home leads to a multiplicative change of 1.0032976 with a 95% confidence range of 1.00271018 to 1.00388491 in Median value of total energy expenditure.       
* For every 1 room increase in the building leads to a multiplicative change of 1.096288 with a 95% confidence interval range of 1.090605 to 1.1020015 in Median value of total energy expenditure.      
* For every 1 year increase in the year the house is made leads to a multiplicative change of 0.9975 with a 95% confidence interval range of 0.99717135 to 0.99782736 in Median value of total energy expenditure.
* When comparing air conditioner used vs NO air conditioner used, people not using an air conditioner has a multiplicative change of 0.69732145 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.66346322 to 0.73290756 in Median value of total energy expenditure when compared to people using an air conditioner.         
* For every 1 day increase in the average 30 year cooling degree days leads to a multiplicative change of 1.00011724 with a 95% confidence interval range of 1.00010361 to 1.00013087 in Median value of total energy expenditure.         
* For every 1 day increase in the average 30 year heating degree days leads to a multiplicative change of 1.00004345 with a 95% confidence interval range of 1.00003678 to 1.00005012 in Median value of total energy expenditure.          
* In the interaction of average 30 year heating degree days and air conditioner used, it shows that the effect of average 30 year heating degree days when air conditioner is not used leads to an increase multiplicative change of 1.00005129 with a 95% confidence interval of 1.00004212 to 1.00006047 in the Median value of energy expenditure when compared to average 30 year heating degree days when air conditioner is used.           

Fit characteristics of the model (\autoref{fig4}) as well as \autoref{table5} let us conclude that all variables are significant at the 99% confidence level. We can see that the residuals are randomly scattered indicating no issues. The leverage plot is of some concern at the near 0.004, however, when looking at the Cook's D there we do not see any values indicating of concern where the largest Cook's D value is 0.10. When looking at the histogram and QQ plots of the residuals, we can see that the residuals are normally distributed, the histogram show a normally distributed response and the QQ plots show majority of point falling on the 45 degree line. We have also tested for multicollinearity between indepedent variables in the descriptive model and found all variance inflation factors to be below 10.  

Here are our conclusions that can be taken from the interpretive model. We can confirm the effect of air conditioning in the building on total dollar energy expenditure. From the model we can see that individuals without a central air unit pay much less compared to individual with central air by a multiplicative change of 0.69 in the median value of log total dollar energy expenditure. The next biggest effect, with a multiplicative change factor of 1.096, is the number of rooms in the household since bigger number of rooms indicates that more people live there which increases the pressure on air and heating unit.  
	Things to note in this model, is the factors used in this regression do not have large effects when compared to *AIRCOND* indicating that it may not be really different from zero in a practical sense. Therefore, for future analysis, other variables such as what temperature was set at home, gone, and night during the summer time since we can see that *AIRCOND* has a significant effect should be included in the model. Other things to consider is maybe finding a better heating unit variable than the one chosen for the subset since the *EQUIPNOHEAT* has many categories which makes it hard to estimate and have little data in some categories. Another thing we have not considered is to add region and its interaction with the variables to better understand the effect of *AIRCOND* on region since each region has its own climate.

## Energy cost comparison

In this section we compare total mean energy cost for different types of settlements (urban vs rural) and year of construction (in 10-year ranges).
Group differencies are visualized in \autoref{fig8}. From plots you can see that there is a clear difference between average energy spendings for households in rural versus urban areas. While  both lines on the left side of \autoref{fig8} does not seem to be exactly parallel ANOVA results show that there is no iteraction between type of settlement and construction year. 
From \autoref{table2} and \autoref{table3} we conclude that:

* The levels of *Construction Year* are associated with statistically significant different energy cost (p-value < 0.00001).
* The levels of *Settlement Type* are associated with statistically significant different energy cost (p-value < 0.00001 ).
* The interaction between *Construction Year* and *Settlement Type*  statistically insignificant, which indicates that the relationships between *Settlement Type* and energy cost does not depends on the *Construction Year* (p-value 0.13).

### Model Assumptions

ANOVA assumes that errors are normally distributed and independent and that the variance across groups is homogeneous. To test that both there assumptions holds we looked at residuals versus fit and QQ plots (\autoref{fig9}). We haven't found any significant deviations from both assumptions except for one outlier household which turned out to be an error.
